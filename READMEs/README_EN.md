# Costume-Client Mod for #SaveCW Costumes

#SaveCW Costumes is a project by #SaveCW that allows players to create and use custom costumes in the CatWar game. <br> 

Recent updates to the game have introduced restrictions against "unrealistic" costumes, limiting players' creative expression. Our community-developed mod allows for the use of personalized costumes. 
<br>

<b>Please note</b>, to see each other's custom costumes, both players must have the mod installed. This mod is purely cosmetic and does not impact gameplay.

If you don't see your cat's avatar in the upload screen, you can click on the **"Fetch Your Cat"** button to get your cat's avatar (This is used mostly for you to see how your costume will look on your cat)

To upload a costume you should click on "Choose File" and select the image of your costume (We recommend using a 100x150 image for the best results)

Below you can see the **"Upload Costume"** button, click on it to upload your costume! 

Once you have uploaded your costume you will be able to see it in the game! (If you don't see it, try refreshing the page)

At any time you can click on the **"Logout"** button to log out of the mod if you need to do so.
