# Costume-Client Mod for #SaveCW Costumes

![#SaveCW Costumes](./icons/icon.png)

#SaveCW Costumes is a project by #SaveCW that allows players to create and use custom costumes in the CatWar game. <br> 

Recent updates to the game have introduced restrictions against "unrealistic" costumes, limiting players' creative expression. Our community-developed mod allows for the use of personalized costumes. 
<br>

<b>Please note</b>, to see each other's custom costumes, both players must have the mod installed. This mod is purely cosmetic and does not impact gameplay.
